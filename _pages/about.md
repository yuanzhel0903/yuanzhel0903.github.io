I am a Master's student in Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from UW–Madison. I am interested in the capability of embodied agents and applying them for perception, reasoning, and planning in the physical world. My work lies at the intersection of **Multimodal Learning** (VLMs/MLLMs), **Robot Learning** (Robotic Foundation Models, VLA), and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

I am currently a Research Assistant at UIUC, where I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Ismini Lourentzou](https://isminoula.github.io/) and Prof. [James M. Rehg](https://rehg.org/). During my Master's studies at Penn, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) and Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/).
