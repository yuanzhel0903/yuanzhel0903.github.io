I am a Master's student in Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from UW–Madison. I am interested in the capability of embodied agents and applying them for perception, reasoning, and planning in the physical world. My work primarily focuses on **Multimodal Learning** (VLMs/MLLMs), **Robotic Learning** (Robot Foundation Models, VLA), and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.
